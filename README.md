# Godot: 3D endless runner sample

This Godot (4.2) project is a _very simple_ sample of a 3D endless runner game. It implements some of the basics of this genre:

1. The player runs endlessly.
1. There is a track with 3 lanes. The player switches from lane to lane with arrow keys.
1. There are obstacles to avoid. Hitting an obstacle ends the game.
1. There are collectibles to collect. Touching a collectible removes it and adds to the score.

## Keys:

- left and right arrow keys to move left and right
- up arrow to jump
- down arrow to slide
